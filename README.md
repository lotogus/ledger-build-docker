# ledger-build-docker
dockerfile for building a Ledger App. It's an builder alternative to https://github.com/fix/ledger-vagrant , I couldn't make work so I've tried with Docker!

## run

being:
 
    /home/user/apps -> your apps folder, 

    /home/user/apps/ledger-build-docker -> this project,

    /home/user/apps/blue-app-csc -> the project that you want to compile

running:

    cd /home/user/apps/ledger-build-docker
    docker build . ##--> this will return an hash on the last line, eg: Successfully built c8638d26b08e
    cd ..
    docker run -it -v /home/user/apps:/root/apps c8638d26b08e

then you can go to /root and compile it!

## compile example

	cd /root
	cd blue-app-csc
	make clean
	make
